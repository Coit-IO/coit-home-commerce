## Quickstart (GKE)

```
cd kubernetes-manifests
kubectl apply -f .
```

**Now Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

```
kubectl get pods
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```

```

**Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```
kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
```

*Example output - do not copy*

```
EXTERNAL-IP
<your-ip>
```

**Note**- you may see `<pending>` while your cloud provider provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.


## Architecture

**Coit Home Ecommerce** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.
